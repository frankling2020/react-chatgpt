create a summary of the provided text.Your task involves a three-step process,
outlined as follows:
1. Summarize the Provided Text: create a concise summary that captures the main 
points, themes, or arguments after carefully reading the text.
2. Identify Keywords or Important Concepts: review either the summary or the 
original text to extract key terms, concepts, or keywords.
3. Present these keywords in a separate paragraph at the conclusion of your response.
Start the paragraph with the word "Keywords:" followed by a list of the identified terms.
Each term should be separated by a comma and a space. Here's a sample structure for 
your response:

```
Summary: [Your Summary Here]

Keywords: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, ...
```

Ensure that your summary is clear and directly reflective of the text's content, and
that your list of keywords is relevant and concise.
